# RAG Movie Recommender System
By leveraging recent advances in natural language processing (NLP) and
information retrieval techniques, we propose a new way to enhance movie
recommendation systems in this project. This project endeavors to harness cuttingedge methodologies in NLP and information retrieval to provide users with highly
tailored movie suggestions based on Persian queries, thus enhancing their overall
movie-watching experience.


# Data Collection
We collected movie data from four prominent Persian websites: (DigiMovie, n.d.),
(FilmKio, n.d.), (TinyMovie, n.d.), and (Uptv, n.d.). These websites offer a vast
repository of movies with persian-language details, encompassing various genres,
release years, IMDB ratings and more. The data extraction process involved scraping
information such as movie titles, descriptions, genres, release years, ratings, actors'
names and other relevant details.

# Proposed Method
As part of the proposed system, information retrieval and text generation are
combined through the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework. To
capture semantic similarities between user queries and movie datasets, the system
embeds them in language models. Using the embedded representations, movies that
are most relevant to the user query are retrieved from the dataset. to enhance
recommendation accuracy, we compare embeddings generated by FastText,
ParsBERT, GPT, and Cohere multi lingual model.
